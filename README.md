# character-timeline

Overall Idea
A website that keeps track of character arcs during a book or series. You'd be able to view a book with simple parameters like what chapter you're on. If it's a series, parameters include the books as well. You'll be able to view a list of characters withe their basic information based off what you would know at that point in the series. If you view a specific character you'll see a full timeline of that character up to the point you're at in the book. It should provide information such as current location, appearance, recent activity, etc.
